### [7] Day 8: 2016-12-27

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100-days-of-code, started reading Eloquent JavaScript, practiced making modular CSS, applied for Launch School scholarship && assigned to myself a couple of WWC website issues involving Rubocop inspection (cloned repository to Cloud9, installed rubocop gem, ran inspection to find 54 offenses)

**Thoughts**: Slow and steady wins the race. And getting my feet wet is the only way I'll get better at all the new web dev stuff like Ruby on Rails and PostgresSQL

### [8] Day 9: 2016-12-28

**Today's Progress**: Almost 3 hours of work today! After running Rubocop inspection on Women Who Code website, I fixed 6 offenses. After much deliberation of trying to figure out Cloud9 => Github stuff, I finally submitted a pull request for merge through Github itself.

**Thoughts**: That took a long time for a quick fix! Plus, I had to leave 10 offenses because the were code related. Felt REALLY good to tweak formatting issues (I'm a Pub Spec, after all), but realized I need to:
*  learn to clone and push branches to Github (use script WWC has available)
*  refresh my memory of Ruby syntax

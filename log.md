### [4] Day 5: 2016-12-24

**Today's Progress**: More @FreeCodeCamp API work. Had fun initiating a Mars weather Web app. #justbecause #webdev

**Thoughts**: APIs FTW! Mars 511 has been rattling around my head too long.

### [6] Day 7: 2016-12-26

**Today's Progress**: Started local weather Web app @FreeCodeCamp && submitted some issues @github

**Thoughts**:  Wow! I've done this for a week now! Toggl recorded 10 hours 15 minutes of coding this week.

### [7] Day 8: 2016-12-27

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100-days-of-code, started reading Eloquent JavaScript, practiced making modular CSS, applied for Launch School scholarship && assigned to myself a couple of WWC website issues involving Rubocop inspection (cloned repository to Cloud9, installed rubocop gem, ran inspection to find 54 offenses)

**Thoughts**: Slow and steady wins the race. And getting my feet wet is the only way I'll get better at all the new web dev stuff like Ruby on Rails and PostgresSQL

### [8] Day 9: 2016-12-28

**Today's Progress**: Almost 3 hours of work today! After running Rubocop inspection on Women Who Code website, I fixed 6 offenses. After much deliberation of trying to figure out Cloud9 => Github stuff, I finally submitted a pull request for merge through Github itself.

**Thoughts**: That took a long time for a quick fix! Plus, I had to leave 10 offenses because the were code related. Felt REALLY good to tweak formatting issues (I'm a Pub Spec, after all), but realized I need to:
*  learn to clone and push branches to Github (use script WWC has available)
*  refresh my memory of Ruby syntax

### [9] Day 10: 2016-12-29

**Today's Progress**: Merged branch with WWC which fixed some syntax issues. Wrestled with code for Weather API.

**Thoughts**: MY FIRST PULL REQUEST MERGED WITH WWC!!!

### [10] Day 11: 2016-12-30

**Today's Progress**: Created a repo for Eloquent JavaScript solutions && did the first quick exercise of looping to create a hash triangle. More work on Local Weather app - finding code for API, Celsius conversion, switch/case for images, && geolocation user info. Another issue for WWC tackled involving rubocop inspection and correcting spacing issues in Ruby code.

**Thoughts**: This Weather app is weighing me down. But I know I can do this. I'm starting to think other pens I've looked up just had code copied in rather than hand-coded. =[  Want to complete it this weekend because I'm more interested in design, as this point.

### [11] Day 12: 2016-12-31

**Today's Progress**: Got weather data to filter in! And jQuery UI radio buttons to toggle between active states, while temp changes. Now working through the change of background images to represent weather.

**Thoughts**: Moving forward! This learning process can help me move forward with my Mars511 app, hopefully! Happy that this should be submitted tomorrow, which will be a great start to 2017! I want to go back and forth between FCC challenges and WWC updates to keep learning something new, but adding some real contribution.

### [12] Day 13: 2017-1-1

**Today's Progress**: Resolved why background wouldn't change. Solved Eloquent JavaScript's "Fizz Buzz" exercise.

**Thoughts**: Hello, 2017! Let's make this a great year, eh? Happy that my weather app is functional and just needs some tweaks. A little slowed down by Eloquent JavaScript's exercises. They're good! But they remind me that most of my basic JS knowledge is just facts and theories without actually having much practice putting them to use. All in all, it's a good signifier for the rest of the year. Two weeks are behind me now and I'm still motivated to continue and be better, despite any avoidance issues I have with certain JS problem solving...

### [13] Day 14: 2017-1-2

**Today's Progress**: Submitted local weather app project to FCC. Installed Lubuntu on my netbook. Started working on my personal site (est. 2015 w/o edits or love). 

**Thoughts**: Decided to not get bogged down in perfectionism, so I abandoned background image changes in my local weather app. Too many images to gather. Maybe some day I'll go back to it. The API learning has been fun, though!

### [14] Day 15: 2017-1-3

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Mars 511 scripting/API call. Also, started HTML5 & JavaScript modules on edX.

**Thoughts**: My .getJSON would appear correct, but still no data.

### [15] Day 16: 2017-1-4

**Today's Progress**: Started FCC Wikipedia Viewer. Learned a little more about CSS3 flexbox and animation.

**Thoughts**: LOVE working with CSS, but I still need to get up-to-speed on CSS3 tricks. Reminded that I'm still in love with the design part of webpages, but not so much the programming part.

### [16] Day 17: 2017-1-5

**Today's Progress**: Started adding JavaScript and API call to FCC Wikipedia Viewer. Refreshing my jQuery memory.

**Thoughts**: APIs are hard but so interesting to learn about. I'll keep chipping away at it by reading other code and experimenting on my own. JQuery has been helpful in this, and I'm not ready to leap into Angular or AJAX (as seen in other code).

### [17] Day 18: 2017-1-6

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my JS for my Wikipedia Viewer for FCC. Learned about .keyup() vs .on('click', target). Also, added the proper link for Random Articles feature.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel like getting up early, but I reasoned that I better stick with this now, or I'll fall out sooner than later.

### [28] Day 29: 2017-1-17

**Today's Progress**: Completed one intermediate algorithm script for Free Code Camp. Created an elephant CSS image for #dailycssimages.

**Thoughts**: Back into scripts again! Excited yet weighed down. More learning to come, though. Played with CSS image to give me a break with some confidence in what skills I do have.

### [29] Day 30: 2017-1-18

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code on WWC with help of rubocop. Created CSS image of beaver for #dailycssimages challenge.

**Thoughts**: Avoiding some of my JS algorithm scripts, but felt good to clean up some code for a real website. Gave me a chance to read through some Ruby code. CSS is still fun. :)

**Today's Progress**: Corrected more Ruby code for WWC. Started attempt on third FCC scripting. Inititated codepen for #dailycssimages tiger.

**Today's Progress**: Daily CSS Image challenge day 4/5 - created Daniel Tiger out of HTML/CSS only. Learned more about using transform: rotate() and clip-path:polygon().

### [33] Day 34: 2017-01-22

**Today's Progress**: Deviation day. Started steps to creating my first Alexa app. Mostly steps and admin stuff, but also played with their index.js file a bit.

**Thoughts**: Nice to look at something else! And a good start to getting more familier with Node.js! Plus, it's always exciting to work with something that could go live and be useful.

### [34] Day 35: 2017-01-23

**Today's Progress**: Started attempt an intermediate algorithm for FCC involving Object.keys() and Object.property.hasOwnProperty() with no solution yet. Created a clock for #dailycssimages Day 6 challenge.

**Thoughts**: Love the CSS challenge, though I should be focusing more on JavaScript. However, I did learn more about animation and keyframes. Challenged myself to read more about objects and keys/values. Apparently ES2017 offers an Object.value() method, so..... maybe investigate more.

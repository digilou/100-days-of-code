**Today's Progress**: Solved one FCC advanced algorithm challenges. Started first FCC advanced project.

**Thoughts**: The advanced algorithms are advanced for me. Yikes! To keep my momentum, I started designing my JS calculator. Design is so much easier and more fun for me. But my work is still contributing to the end of finish the Front End Dev portion of FCC.

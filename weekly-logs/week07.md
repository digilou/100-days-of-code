### [42] Day 43: 2017-01-31

**Today's Progress**: Time spent installing Git on my netbook and reading its documentation. Also, spent some time at work trying out some JavaScript/jQuery hacks for LibGuides A-Z databases.

**Thoughts**: As I become less afriad of the command line, I feel empowered! Also, time spent at work with LibGuides templates and jQuery hacking made it a red-letter day, too.

### [43] Day 44: 2017-02-01

**Today's Progress**: Design updates to my Mars web app like a toggle feature for temperature. Transferred to my website from codepen. Spent some time reading through JS for an enhanced Google calendar embed for work.

**Thoughts**: Not as much focused time today, but wanted to keep contributing and moving forward. Got to use some previous work with jQuery UI to enhance functionality.

### [44] Day 45: 2017-02-02

**Today's Progress**: Styling and content updates for WWC. A little more CSS-love for my Mars web app.

**Thoughts**: I heart design. I also love the feeling I get when I merge my branch to a master project that's governed by someonelse! (merged a content update with WWC)

### [47] Day 48: 2017-02-05

**Today's Progress**: Design updates to my Mars web app with a mobile-first approach. Work on incorporating NASA API for Mars images. And continued setup on netbook for web dev environment with Git and Aptana.

**Thoughts**: Design progress is slow, but progress is being made. More concentration on family today rather than deep problem solving.

### [48] Day 49: 2017-02-06

**Today's Progress**: Editing of JavaScript file before submission of Alexa Skill. Rebasing pull request update on WWC site. Started creating Frankenstein's monster with CSS.

**Thoughts**: Gah! Apparently I DO NOT understand rebasing in Git. I'll have to work on it. Alexa Skill is coming along, I just need to spend more time with it. Started on CSS image to regain my footing in confidence again and see some actual results somewhere.

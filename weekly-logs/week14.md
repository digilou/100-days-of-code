## [91] Day 92: 2017-03-21

**Today's Progress**: JS Calculator.

**Thoughts**: The equations work! I resorted to eval for the basics to work. It will need further tweaking in order to be something I'm proud of. But it WORKS.

## [92] Day 93: 2017-03-22

**Today's Progress**: Started pomodoro clock. Focused on design and code.

**Thoughts**: This time I spent less time designing (best part!) and more time thinking logically through the functionality of it. I felt more like a programmer rather than a designer as I started commenting through the steps I needed to take to make it work. Made me feel good about myself. Feeling a little rushed because I want to meet my goal of earning my front-end certificate on Day 100. Seven days to go with 3 advanced projects to complete....

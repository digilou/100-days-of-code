### [70] Day 71: 2017-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Corrected 177 redundant self offenses on WWC website. Submitted pull request. Submitted final answer for one FCC advanced algorithm.

**Thoughts**: I messed it up once before after rebasing. Doing it over again, I found myself to be more efficient when working through it all again. Completed in under an hour this time!

**Link(s) to work**:

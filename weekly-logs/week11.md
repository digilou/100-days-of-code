### [70] Day 71: 2017-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Corrected 177 redundant self offenses on WWC website. Submitted pull request. Submitted final answer for one FCC advanced algorithm.

**Thoughts**: I messed it up once before after rebasing. Doing it over again, I found myself to be more efficient when working through it all again. Completed in under an hour this time!

### [73] Day 74: 2017-03-03

**Today's Progress**: Formation of new portfolio idea. HTML and CSS first, alongside content brainstorming. Began utilizing SCSS for the first time.

**Thoughts**: WOW. Today was a flow day. I finally came up with some good ideas for content, and the design started forming after that. And who knew that all this dev reading was sinking in? Suddenly I was able to start writing basic SCSS (variables, nesting) for my portfolio! Thanks, Codepen, for offering an easy to use online front-end dev environment during initial stages. It's much faster than trying to work from a local machine. So so SO pleased that I'm making progress and finally satisfied with the direction it's going!

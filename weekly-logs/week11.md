### [70] Day 71: 2017-02-28

**Today's Progress**: Corrected 177 redundant self offenses on WWC website. Submitted pull request. Submitted final answer for one FCC advanced algorithm.

**Thoughts**: I messed it up once before after rebasing. Doing it over again, I found myself to be more efficient when working through it all again. Completed in under an hour this time!

### [73] Day 74: 2017-03-03

**Today's Progress**: Formation of new portfolio idea. HTML and CSS first, alongside content brainstorming. Began utilizing SCSS for the first time.

**Thoughts**: WOW. Today was a flow day. I finally came up with some good ideas for content, and the design started forming after that. And who knew that all this dev reading was sinking in? Suddenly I was able to start writing basic SCSS (variables, nesting) for my portfolio! Thanks, Codepen, for offering an easy to use online front-end dev environment during initial stages. It's much faster than trying to work from a local machine. So so SO pleased that I'm making progress and finally satisfied with the direction it's going!

### [75] Day 76: 2017-03-05

**Today's Progress**: More nitty-gritty design with inclusion and mobile in mind.

**Thoughts**: A bit slower progress now that the design is getting more detailed. Added some images which make the page come alive. Lots of experimentation with color scheme and spacing. Stepped into media queries.

### [76] Day 77: 2017-03-06

**Today's Progress**: Added more jQuery (funcitonality) to FCC JS calculator. Starting exploring idea of how to make it keyboard accessible. Set up a Cloud9 workspace for FCC to start contributing to their site and assigning myself to issues. Also, merged a couple of my branches with Women Who Code.

**Thoughts**: Projects are fun. Rather than build something else that didn't contribute to my overall progress, I chose to work on an FCC project. I also have gained enough confidence to start contributing more to open source projects on Github, starting with FCC.

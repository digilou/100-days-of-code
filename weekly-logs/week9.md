### [56] Day 57: 2017-02-14

**Today's Progress**: Ruby coding convention corrections using Rubocop. Learned about "redundant self" and integers separated by '_' after 3 indexes.

**Thoughts**: Time spent in Ruby as a code monkey will pay off someday, I hope. The time volunteering with Women Who Code definitely has been learning experience in a team setting! Happy Valentine's Day to myself and my aspiration to be a professional coder! Showed off my CSS heart to Tom today, also. Very proud that I can make personal things for people I care about. :)

### [57] Day 58: 2017-02-15

**Today's Progress**: Ruby coding convention corrections using Rubocop. Learned about "Exclude" to ignore certain files like auto-generated files. More practice using Git commands to add, commit, and push code to Github. Revisited Learn.co Ruby tutorials to consider applying for a WWC-sponsored Flatiron Bootcamp scholarship.

**Thoughts**: JavaScript is still my priority, but I'm trying to weave in a little Ruby now and then so I can contribute more to the Women Who Code website.

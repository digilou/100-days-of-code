## [98] Day 99: 2017-03-28

**Today's Progress**: Pomodoro timer ticks down but hits negative numbers. Function stringing.

**Thoughts**: My code is better but it still doesn't do everything I want. I WILL get this working on Day 100!!

## [99] Day 100: 2017-03-29

**Today's Progress**: Got the main countdown to work after removing frills. Added customizable countdowns for work and break times, and a reset button.

**Thoughts**: Whew! What a doozie! A little anticlimatic because I'm so focused on the things I still want to accomplish. My 100 day challenge is complete, and I did it thanks to commitment, perserverance and accountability. I'd do it all over again! Writing a blog post about my experience now. And planning for my next 100 days. I'm not done coding and I'm definitely not done bettering myself.

### [42] Day 43: 2017-01-31

**Today's Progress**: Time spent installing Git on my netbook and reading its documentation. Also, spent some time at work trying out some JavaScript/jQuery hacks for LibGuides A-Z databases.

**Thoughts**: As I become less afriad of the command line, I feel empowered! Also, time spent at work with LibGuides templates and jQuery hacking made it a red-letter day, too.

### [43] Day 44: 2017-02-01

**Today's Progress**: Design updates to my Mars web app like a toggle feature for temperature. Transferred to my website from codepen. Spent some time reading through JS for an enhanced Google calendar embed for work.

**Thoughts**: Not as much focused time today, but wanted to keep contributing and moving forward. Got to use some previous work with jQuery UI to enhance functionality.

### [44] Day 45: 2017-02-02

**Today's Progress**: Styling and content updates for WWC. A little more CSS-love for my Mars web app.

**Thoughts**: I heart design. I also love the feeling I get when I merge my branch to a master project that's governed by someonelse! (merged a content update with WWC)

**Today's Progress**: Styling updates to WWC .scss files. (correctly this time)

**Thoughts**: I'm still learning about git commands. That's a good thing.

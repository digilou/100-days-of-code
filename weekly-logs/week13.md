## [85] Day 86: 2017-03-15

**Today's Progress**: Design and content work on portfolio. WWC updates. Experimented with CSS Grid.

**Thoughts**: Squeaked by getting my broken-up hour today. The grid thing wasn't successful, but I have much to learn still. It's an early start to a new CSS feature that offers promise.

**Today's Progress**: More design and content work on portfolio (specifically media queries). Merged page update for WWC. Designed a robot with CSS. Submitted my first accessibility issue to Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts**: A full day of successes. It's nice to contribute to another's project, as well as progress with my own. The robot couldn't be passed up because it's in honor of my robot-loving toddler.

### [49] Day 50: 2017-02-07

**Today's Progress**: Another attempt at WWC rebasing. Wrote one FCC intermediate algorithm script. 

**Thoughts**: Rebasing is frustrating! But working through an algorithm with a completed solution made me feel better. On the positive: I've coded for 50 days straight. Halfway through the challenge!!

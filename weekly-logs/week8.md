### [49] Day 50: 2017-02-07

**Today's Progress**: Another attempt at WWC rebasing. Wrote one FCC intermediate algorithm script. 

**Thoughts**: Rebasing is frustrating! But working through an algorithm with a completed solution made me feel better. On the positive: I've coded for 50 days straight. Halfway through the challenge!!

### [50] Day 51: 2017-02-08

**Today's Progress**: Rebase resolved. Rubocop configurations made and pushed for testing. Also, made a list of CSS images I want to work on someday while I focus on JavaScript right now.

**Thoughts**: So... it turned out that I just had to use git push --force to get my rebase changes to work. *sigh* Onward and upward.

### [51] Day 52: 2017-02-09

**Today's Progress**: Learned about defensive programming techniques for JSON and HTML5. Completed one FCC intermediate algorithm script involving switch/case, for loop, and arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Still no master at JavaScript, but it feels less intimidating even though I can still feel pretty ignorant some times. And it still feels pretty good being over the hump of the challenge and feel like I'm making progress.

### [52] Day 53: 2017-02-10

**Today's Progress**: Finished learning about defensive programming techniques and started blogging about it. Completed one FCC intermediate algorithm script involving .charCode(), fromCharCode(), and RegExp. 

**Thoughts**: That was an interesting script challenge, but a doozy! I keep plodding through, anyhow. Took 15 minutes at the beginning of the day to do a quick Daily CSS Images challenge of my monster of choice: Elmo.

### [53] Day 54: 2017-02-11

**Today's Progress**: Time spent on intermediate algorthim scripting on Free Code Camp which taught me more about .reduce(), arguments, and Boolean objects (primitive booleans, specifically). 

**Thoughts**: I'm still finding that I need help, despite reading. But my understanding is still increasing. And I'm happy that I understand so much more than I did last year at this time. It's nice to be plowing through a few of these, too!

### [54] Day 55: 2017-02-12

**Today's Progress**: Time spent on intermediate algorthim scripting on Free Code Camp which taught me more about RegExp, replace(), and while loops. Started a CSS image of a beating heart to complete by V-Day.

**Thoughts**: Blah! Will I ever be able to code basic JavaScript without having to read and re-read documentation over and over again??

### [55] Day 56: 2017-02-13

**Today's Progress**: Completed a CSS image of a beating heart for V-Day for my husband.

**Thoughts**: Woohoo! Something fun and imaginitive to share with Tom.

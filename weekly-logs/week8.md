### [49] Day 50: 2017-02-07

**Today's Progress**: Another attempt at WWC rebasing. Wrote one FCC intermediate algorithm script. 

**Thoughts**: Rebasing is frustrating! But working through an algorithm with a completed solution made me feel better. On the positive: I've coded for 50 days straight. Halfway through the challenge!!

### [50] Day 51: 2017-02-08

**Today's Progress**: Rebase resolved. Rubocop configurations made and pushed for testing. Also, made a list of CSS images I want to work on someday while I focus on JavaScript right now.

**Thoughts**: So... it turned out that I just had to use git push --force to get my rebase changes to work. *sigh* Onward and upward.

### [51] Day 52: 2017-02-09

**Today's Progress**: Learned about defensive programming techniques for JSON and HTML5. Completed one FCC intermediate algorithm script involving switch/case, for loop, and arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Still no master at JavaScript, but it feels less intimidating even though I can still feel pretty ignorant some times. And it still feels pretty good being over the hump of the challenge and feel like I'm making progress.

### [14] Day 15: 2017-1-3

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Mars 511 scripting/API call. Also, started HTML5 & JavaScript modules on edX.

**Thoughts**: My .getJSON would appear correct, but still no data.

### [15] Day 16: 2017-1-4

**Today's Progress**: Started FCC Wikipedia Viewer. Learned a little more about CSS3 flexbox and animation.

**Thoughts**: LOVE working with CSS, but I still need to get up-to-speed on CSS3 tricks. Reminded that I'm still in love with the design part of webpages, but not so much the programming part.

### [16] Day 17: 2017-1-5

**Today's Progress**: Started adding JavaScript and API call to FCC Wikipedia Viewer. Refreshing my jQuery memory.

**Thoughts**: APIs are hard but so interesting to learn about. I'll keep chipping away at it by reading other code and experimenting on my own. JQuery has been helpful in this, and I'm not ready to leap into Angular or AJAX (as seen in other code).

### [17] Day 18: 2017-1-6

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my JS for my Wikipedia Viewer for FCC. Learned about .keyup() vs .on('click', target). Also, added the proper link for Random Articles feature. Started on WWC updates again.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel like getting up early, but I reasoned that I better stick with this now, or I'll fall out sooner than later.

### [18] Day 19: 2017-1-7

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my JS for my Wikipedia Viewer for FCC. No data yet.

**Thoughts**: Gah! I feel like my code looks great and makes sense. What am I missing?

### [19] Day 20: 2017-1-8

**Today's Progress**: Worked on my JS for my Wikipedia Viewer for FCC. After resolving .ajax is more flexible than .getJSON && combing other people's code, I finally got mine working. A little reading in "JavaScript and AJAX for Dummies" and "Learning Web App Developemnt" helped spur me on. ALSO, started my own Github portfolio.

**Thoughts**: Determined to refactor and re-style before turning in. This one drove me nuts! Granted I'm getting a better idea how to access APIs.

### [20] Day 21: 2017-1-9

**Today's Progress**: Worked on styling for my Wikipedia Viewer for FCC. Updated to make more mobile friendly. I also added more content, structure, and styling to my Github portfolio. Plus, added to the WWC README.md file and submitted a pull request.

**Thoughts**: I was more than ready to move on. 3 weeks down already??

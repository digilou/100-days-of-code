### [77] Day 78: 2017-03-07

**Today's Progress**: Finished another advanced algorithm. Did some design tweaking on calculator.

**Thoughts**: One more algorithm to go! Knocking 'em out. Also, starting to consider how my calculator can be keyboard accessible, if not already. Need to do some testing. Sprouting the idea of 100 Days of Accessiblity after my 100 Days of Code is up.

**Today's Progress**: Completed last advanced algorithm scripting for Free Code Camp!!!

**Thoughts**: Soooooo happy to move on to projects which couple design and logic, rather than just logic.

### [79] Day 80: 2017-03-09

**Today's Progress**: Worked on more functinoality for my JS calculator. Did some read-search for help.

**Thoughts**: Read-search assured me I was actually on the right track! That was encouraging. Now I'm running through a tutorial via tutsplus.com for more functionality.

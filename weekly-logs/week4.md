### [21] Day 22: 2017-1-10

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch.tv API for FCC. Added a little more structure and content to Github porfolio.

**Thoughts**: Missed my early morning session and work was super busy, so I almost missed out on my hour of code. Squeezed in two half-hour sessions to make the day count and not lose time or focus. Still set on getting through as much FCC as possible during #100daysofcode.

### [22] Day 23: 2017-1-11

**Today's Progress**: Attempted solving a JavaScript kata in CodeWars which involved .split() and RegExp.

**Thoughts**: The kata challenge gave me more confidence that SOMETHING is sinking in. I actually thought through a solution myself and got more than error results for my attempts! I'm still missing something, but I made good progress.

### [23] Day 24: 2017-1-12

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Twitch.tv API for FCC.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel like getting up, but knowing I'm about a quarter of the way through this challenge, I said, "get up and keep doing this."

### [24] Day 25: 2017-1-13

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS kata that was eating away at me two days ago after reading up on RegExp in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Had to get some help on this one, but learned a lot about RegExp and corrected my redundancy in code. After completion I learned about an even better way to code it without if/else. On a high note, I'm a quarter of the way through #100daysofcode!

### [25] Day 26: 2017-1-14

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Twitch.tv API for FCC. Still wrestling with the JavaScript, but also added more styling for the list output.

**Thoughts**: Feeling more confident in API functionality and JSON. Code doesn't work yet, but at least I'm seeing results and deducing steps to take with Chrome Console. It's nice that the fog is clearing a bit! Either my focus is becoming sharper, or I'm drinking enough caffeine.

### [26] Day 27: 2017-1-15

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC Twitch.tv API. Started FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripts with an attempt at "Sum all numbers in a range".

**Thoughts**: Glad that's over! Feel more comfortable with APIs, getJSON, jQuery, if/else, and forEach. But really ready for more exposure in other areas.

### [21] Day 22: 2017-1-10

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch.tv API for FCC. Added a little more structure and content to Github porfolio.

**Thoughts**: Missed my early morning session and work was super busy, so I almost missed out on my hour of code. Squeezed in two half-hour sessions to make the day count and not lose time or focus. Still set on getting through as much FCC as possible during #100daysofcode.

### [22] Day 23: 2017-1-11

**Today's Progress**: Attempted solving a JavaScript kata in CodeWars which involved .split() and RegExp.

**Thoughts**: The kata challenge gave me more confidence that SOMETHING is sinking in. I actually thought through a solution myself and got more than error results for my attempts! I'm still missing something, but I made good progress.

### [21] Day 22: 2017-1-10

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch.tv API for FCC. Added a little more structure and content to Github porfolio.

**Thoughts**: Missed my early morning session and work was super busy, so I almost missed out on my hour of code. Squeezed in two half-hour sessions to make the day count and not lose time or focus. Still set on getting through as much FCC as possible during #100daysofcode.

### [22] Day 23: 2017-1-11

**Today's Progress**: Attempted solving a fundamental JavaScript kata in CodeWars in less than an hour, but the server was having problems.

**Thoughts**: The kata challenge gave me a little confidence that SOMETHING is sinking in, even though the fog still exists.

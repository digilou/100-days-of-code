### [21] Day 22: 2017-1-10

**Today's Progress**: Started Twitch.tv API for FCC. Added a little more structure and content to Github porfolio.

**Thoughts**: Missed my early morning session and work was super busy, so I almost missed out on my hour of code. Squeezed in two half-hour sessions to make the day count and not lose time or focus. Still set on getting through as much FCC as possible during #100daysofcode.

### [22] Day 23: 2017-1-11

**Today's Progress**: Attempted solving a JavaScript kata in CodeWars which involved .split() and RegExp.

**Thoughts**: The kata challenge gave me more confidence that SOMETHING is sinking in. I actually thought through a solution myself and got more than error results for my attempts! I'm still missing something, but I made good progress.

### [23] Day 24: 2017-1-12

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Twitch.tv API for FCC.

**Thoughts**: Didn't feel like getting up, but knowing I'm about a quarter of the way through this challenge, I said, "get up and keep doing this."

### [24] Day 25: 2017-1-13

**Today's Progress**: Completed JS kata that was eating away at me two days ago after reading up on RegExp in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Thoughts**: Had to get some help on this one, but learned a lot about RegExp and corrected my redundancy in code. After completion I learned about an even better way to code it without if/else. On a high note, I'm a quarter of the way through #100daysofcode!

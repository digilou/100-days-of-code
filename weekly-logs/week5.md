### [28] Day 29: 2017-1-17

**Today's Progress**: Completed one intermediate algorithm script for Free Code Camp. Created an elephant CSS image for #dailycssimages.

**Thoughts**: Back into scripts again! Excited yet weighed down. More learning to come, though. Played with CSS image to give me a break with some confidence in what skills I do have.

### [29] Day 30: 2017-1-18

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned up code on WWC with help of rubocop. Created CSS image of beaver for #dailycssimages challenge.

**Thoughts**: Avoiding some of my JS algorithm scripts, but felt good to clean up some code for a real website. Gave me a chance to read through some Ruby code. CSS is still fun. :)

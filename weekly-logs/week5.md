### [28] Day 29: 2017-1-17

**Today's Progress**: Completed one intermediate algorithm script for Free Code Camp. Created an elephant CSS image for #dailycssimages.

**Thoughts**: Back into scripts again! Excited yet weighed down. More learning to come, though. Played with CSS image to give me a break with some confidence in what skills I do have.

### [35] Day 36: 2017-01-24

**Today's Progress**: Began work on CSS ruler. Started reading about HTML5 video, audio, and codecs (Beginning HTML5 Media by Silvia Pfeiffer)

**Thoughts**: Busy busy and sick today, so bare minimum of coding done.

### [36] Day 37: 2017-01-25

**Today's Progress**: More learning about HTML5 codec types and video features. Learned about git pull --rebase for WWC website updates, which led me to doing more coding convention updates.

**Thoughts**: Reading was a useful break. As was updating some Ruby code. Sometimes you just gotta be the guy that cleans up the code (which gives me a chance to read and learn from other people's code!). Bonus: more familiarity with Git commands!

### [37] Day 38: 2017-01-26

**Today's Progress**: Solved some problems with WWC site for coding conventions. Mostly more learning about rubocop and submitted an issue for discussion. Discovered [CodinGame](http://codingame.com) and ran through one JavaScript tutorial.

**Thoughts**: My cold has set me back a bit from tackling bigger things, but I'm still committed to doing SOMETHING every day.

### [38] Day 39: 2017-01-27

**Today's Progress**: Read through more Alexa skill docs to catch up on my City Guide skill progress. Made an attempt at Free Code Camp's "Wherefor Art Thou" intermediate algorithm.

**Thoughts**: I have to sign up for AWS with a credit card so I've been a bit delayed on that project. I'm feeling a little more confident about the direction of my FCC solution. I'm determined to figure out how to use ES2017's Object.entries() as part of my solution. It just seems cleaner.

### [35] Day 36: 2017-01-24

**Today's Progress**: Began work on CSS ruler. Started reading about HTML5 video, audio, and codecs (Beginning HTML5 Media by Silvia Pfeiffer)

**Thoughts**: Busy busy and sick today, so bare minimum of coding done.

### [36] Day 37: 2017-01-25

**Today's Progress**: More learning about HTML5 codec types and video features. Learned about git pull --rebase for WWC website updates, which led me to doing more coding convention updates.

**Thoughts**: Reading was a useful break. As was updating some Ruby code. Sometimes you just gotta be the guy that cleans up the code (which gives me a chance to read and learn from other people's code!). Bonus: more familiarity with Git commands!

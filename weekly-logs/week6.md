### [35] Day 36: 2017-01-24

**Today's Progress**: Began work on CSS ruler. Started reading about HTML5 video, audio, and codecs (Beginning HTML5 Media by Silvia Pfeiffer)

**Thoughts**: Busy busy and sick today, so bare minimum of coding done.

### [36] Day 37: 2017-01-25

**Today's Progress**: More learning about HTML5 codec types and video features. Learned about git pull --rebase for WWC website updates, which led me to doing more coding convention updates.

**Thoughts**: Reading was a useful break. As was updating some Ruby code. Sometimes you just gotta be the guy that cleans up the code (which gives me a chance to read and learn from other people's code!). Bonus: more familiarity with Git commands!

### [37] Day 38: 2017-01-26

**Today's Progress**: Solved some problems with WWC site for coding conventions. Mostly more learning about rubocop and submitted an issue for discussion. Discovered [CodinGame](http://codingame.com) and ran through one JavaScript tutorial.

**Thoughts**: My cold has set me back a bit from tackling bigger things, but I'm still committed to doing SOMETHING every day.

### [38] Day 39: 2017-01-27

**Today's Progress**: Read through more Alexa skill docs to catch up on my City Guide skill progress. Made an attempt at Free Code Camp's "Wherefor Art Thou" intermediate algorithm. Solved a Project Euler problem.

**Thoughts**: I have to sign up for AWS with a credit card so I've been a bit delayed on that project. I'm feeling a little more confident about the direction of my FCC solution. I'm determined to figure out how to use ES2017's Object.entries() as part of my solution. It just seems cleaner. Additionally, I solved a Project Euler problem since that was more low-hanging fruit that I could walk away with a little confidence that I have learned SOMETHING in JavaScript.

### [39] Day 40: 2017-01-28

**Today's Progress**: Solved "Wherefor Art Thou" challenge on FCC.

**Thoughts**: GAH!! That took way too long trying to figure it out my way. I finally had to ask for help and got a solution that I understand but am still struggling with satisfaction over it. :(  I think I had more interest in the basic algorithms because I want to avoid these intermediate ones like the plague. But I REALLY want this front-end dev certificate. And I have a milestone set to keep me moving forward. I have to change up projects just to keep me wanting to code.

### [40] Day 41: 2017-01-29

**Today's Progress**: Back to my Mars 511 API web app. Started a subdomain on my site for it. Spent time trying to work out CORS issue.

**Thoughts**: I'm happy to know my JS code wasn't bad! But console.log() showed that I had a CORS conflict. *throws hands in air* Oh well. I spent a ton of time trying to figure out how to resolve the cross browser origin thing and still use jQuery. May need to resort to vanilla JavaScript, which would be a learning experience in and of itself.

### [41] Day 42: 2017-01-30

**Today's Progress**: Mars 511 CORS issue (xhr) resolved with JSONP. Spent time on styling after that.

**Thoughts**: It works!!!! Thanks for reading jQuery docs, monitoring Chrome dev console, and putting feelers out on Twitter. Now for the fun part of styling, and dreaming up more features!
